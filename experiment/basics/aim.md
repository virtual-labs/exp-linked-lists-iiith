### Definition of Linked List 

Linked list is a linear data structure where each data is a separate object (of same data type). Linked list objects do not occupy the contiguous memory location as compared to the array which is also a linear data structure where elements have contiguous memory allocation, instead linked lists are linked using pointers. Elements of the linked lists are known as Nodes.

There are three types of linked lists:

  -  Singly Linked List
  -  Doubly Linked List
  -  Circular Linked List
