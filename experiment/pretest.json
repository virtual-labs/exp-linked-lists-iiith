                "a": "The data structure that shows hierarchical behaviour is a tree, and hence it is the wrong answer.",
                "b": "As we have read earlier a simple container for objects of similar types is an array, they might be integer, characters or any custom class objects, Hence this is the correct description for an array.",
                "c": "We have a 'list' that is similar to an array but is a container of objects of mixed types, and hence is not an array and is the wrong answer.",

                "a": "A structure itself acts as a custom data type consisting of the 3 types of data and hence, a single pointer is sufficient to point to the structure.",

                "a": "A pointer pointing to any data type ultimately is just a variable that stores a memory address. The space required to store memory address is independent of what the memory address holds. Hence this is incorrect.",
                "b": "As memory address is always a hexadecimal, it will depend on the system you are using. It will occupy 4 bytes on 32 bit system and 8 bytes on a 64 bit system. But is completely independent on which data type it is storing.",
